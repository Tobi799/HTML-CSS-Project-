        <p>
            Hi, <strong>I am Idowu Oluwatobiloba !</strong> I am a 200 level undergraduate from Covenant Univeristy and
            I am
            a <em><q>Web Designer and also Develop Websites</q></em>. I
            started
            <q>Web Design/Development</q> because I have a <span> strpng passion for IT and technology and also
                to</span> start writing, too.
            After many years of trying to find a job that reflected my love for writing a programming, I decided to take
            matters into my own
            hands and start my own business. <em><q>Web Design/Development</q></em> is an all-in-one writing platform
            that can help fellow aspiring writers
            learn their own way with words. Since I started <em><q>Web Design/Development</q></em> in 2015, it’s
            <em>quickly become one of the most popular
                <span>marketing platforms online, with more than 500,000 subscribers nationwide</em>. I’ve been in your
            shoes before, so here at <em><q>Web Design/Development</q></em>
            my goal is to help you achieve your writing dreams, whatever they may be.
        </p>
        <p>I have a lot of <span>enthusiasm for life and am always looking for new</span> <em>opportunities to learn and
                grow.</em> I am flexible and can adapt
            to new situations and changes quickly and easily. I have a friendly personality and enjoy interacting with
            others. I am genuine,
            <span>enthusiasm for life and am always looking for</span>
